# Etch-a-Sketch

Browser version of crossover of a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch.

Contains grid squares where the number of squares can be edited.
Each square produces a random colour when a mouse passes through it or it is tapped. The same square will then gradually darken for successive hovers until it reaches a certain threshold, which produces another random colour.
